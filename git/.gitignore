# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Solargraph
solargraph.rb
.solargraph.yml

# Jetbrains IDEs
*.idea

# Don't commit certificate private keys
*.pem

# VS Code
.vscode/launch.json

# TypeScript
tsconfig.json

# MacOS
.DS_Store

# Ignore .zsh_private companies secrets files
*.secrets.sh

# Ignore yarn cache files
.yarn/cache/*.*
